# Botpress v13

To run the studio as standalone, first create a bot using botpress on branch `next`.

Copy the path to you bot's folder and provide it as an argument to `yarn start`

On a fresh clone of the repo, these should be the commands that you run at the root of the repo to get a working studio :

`yarn`

`yarn build`

`yarn start -d /my-path/botpress/packages/bp/dist/data/bots/my-bot-id`
